 Static library, header files, and documentation for libuev.

 libuEv is a simple event loop in the style of the more established
 libevent, libev and the venerable Xt(3) event loop. The u (micro) in the
 name refers to both the small feature set and the small size overhead
 impact of the library.
 .
 Experienced developers may appreciate that libuEv is built on top of
 modern Linux APIs: epoll, timerfd and signalfd. Note however, a certain
 amount of care is needed when dealing with APIs that employ signalfd.
