LibuEv TODO
===========

* dpkg -i new-version.deb fails on libuev.so symlink??
* Add standard UNIX backend with select() and timer_create()
  See SMCRoute and toolbox for examples.
* Port to *BSD kqueue API, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue
  Also in UNIX Network Progamming, by W. Richard Stevens 3rd ed.
* Restore Lua bindings now that libuEv itself has stabilized
